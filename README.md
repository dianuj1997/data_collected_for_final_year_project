# Gym Trainee Dataset
[PDF](FYP%20Report.docx)  [Supplementary](FYP%20Defense.pptx)

Accelerometer data was self-collected from 11 male gym trainees from a local gym, “Gemstone Gym”, located in Satellite town, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Each individual’s consent was aquired, and during their bicep routines, they were courteous enough to allow recording of their corresponding bicep movement data. 

This dataset was recorded for my Final year bachelor's project.

The corresponding final year report and corresponding defense of my idea is provided too.
